### What is Machine Learning ?
Machine Learning is the science of programming computers so they can learn from data.

### How do they learn from data ?
Through machine learning algorithms.

### Will I have to learn to create these algorithms ?
No, they are already invented ( by very smart people) and we will only need to know how and when to use them.

### What is a model ?
A model is a trained machine learning algorithm that has been adjusted to generalize the best way to make accurate predictions.

### What are the algorithms that I will need to know?
The most popular machine learning algorithms are:

- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- kNN
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- SVM
- K-means
- Gradient Boosting/AdaBoosting

### Should I go and just dive now?
No, you first need to understand that the above algorithms are classified depending on the type of prediction.
