    "Building the pipeline processes is only one aspect of creating data pipelines; it’s an iterative process that might require you to make updates and changes depending on how technology or business needs change. Because you will want to continue making improvements to the system, you need to **create ways to test any changes before they’re implemented to avoid disrupting users’ access to the data.** This could include **creating a separate staging environment** for data where you can run tests or including a stable dataset that you can make changes to and compare to current processes **without interrupting the current flow.** \n",
