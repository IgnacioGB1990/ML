    "## Week 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data models and pipelines\n",
    "You will start this course by exploring data modeling foundations, as well as common schemas and key database elements. You will also consider how business needs determine the kinds of database systems that a BI professional might implement. You will then shift to learning about pipelines and ETL processes, which are the tools that move data throughout the system and make sure it’s accessible and useful. Along the way, you will add many more important tools to your BI toolbox.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Week 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic database design\n",
    "In this part of the course, you will learn more about database systems, including data marts, data lakes, data warehouses, and ETL processes. You will also investigate the five factors of database performance: workload, throughput, resources, optimization, and contention. Finally, you will begin thinking about how to design efficient queries that get the most from your system. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Week 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "Optimize ETL processes\n",
    "In this section of the course, you will learn about ETL quality testing, data schema validation, verifying business rules, and general performance testing. You will also explore data integrity and learn how built-in quality checks help you discover data defects. Finally, you will learn how to verify business rules and conduct general performance testing to make sure pipelines fulfill the intended business need. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Week 4:\n",
    "\n",
    "Course 2 end-of-course project\n",
    "In the second end-of-course project, you will create a pipeline process to deliver necessary data to a target table. Then, you will use that target table to develop reports based on project needs. After you create the pipeline, you will also ensure that it is performing correctly and that there are built-in defenses against data quality issues. "
