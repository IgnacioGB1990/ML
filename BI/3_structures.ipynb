    "| Involvement  |The first step of the data analysis cycle is to define the business problem and establish stakeholder expectations. |In addition to defining business problems and asking questions to establish expectations, BI professionals observe current processes to determine how they can be improved to align more with stakeholder needs. |\n",
    "| Answering questions | Data analysts are often tasked with deciding what data they need to answer their stakeholders’ questions and gathering that data for use.     |BI professionals evaluate the data needs of their stakeholders, identify necessary sources, and design pipeline systems that automatically and continuously gather that data for stakeholders to access. |\n",
    "| Gathering data    | Once data has been gathered, data analysts must ensure that it is clean and ready for use. They also perform transformations on the data to prepare it for analysis.   |BI professionals build tools that clean and transform data automatically within a pipeline so that these processes occur to all data being ingested by the pipeline process. |\n",
    "| Storage systems    | Data analysts must adhere to organization conventions and store historical data for analysis.    |BI professionals develop storage systems that allow intake from multiple source systems into a destination database, while governing the database schema and optimizing the system. |\n",
    "| Descriptive and predictive analytics    | Data analysis focuses on descriptive analysis that describes historical trends.    |BI uses analysis of historical trends to perform predictive analytics that enable organizations to determine likely future trends and act accordingly. |\n",
    "| Presenting insights    |After analysis, data analysts present their findings to inform the stakeholders’ ultimate decision.    |BI analysts create tables, reports, and dashboards that empower stakeholders with access to the data they need to inform their whole decision-making process.|\n",
    "| Iteration    | After the initial analysis, data analysts may repeat their analysis based on their findings or new information.    |BI analysts continue to iterate on processes to improve and optimize the systems and tools they have built to ensure they continue to be useful for stakeholders. |\n",

    "DA and BI share a lot of common ground: They are both fields in which professionals use data to create insights that inform decision-making. But BI is more focused on **creating processes and information channels** that transform relevant data into actionable insights that are easily available to decision-makers on a continual basis."
